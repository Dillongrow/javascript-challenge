# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Summary

Wrote code that will create a table dynamically based upon a "UFO Sightings Dataset". I also set up to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. This was done purely though JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on my web pages.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page

* Used the UFO dataset provided by Trilogy Education Services in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.



### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Has all of Level 1 steps.

* Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
